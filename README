matrix-vector mulitplication in parallel
****************************************

This program will generate an nxm matrix and vector filled with random doubles.
The matrix rows are passed to different processes along with the vector and multiplications are performed in parallel. Results are returned to the original process and printed there.
This implementation uses the MPI library for message passing.

build and run:
	make
	mpirun -np 4 ./matvec 10 10
	(this will spawn 4 processes to handle the job, where 10 is the matrix width and height)

Output: result vector.
				result vector by different method for testing
				if vectors match: true
									 else: false
